                        <p>“Not enough attention has been given to this population of students who we need to provide with every opportunity to have as normal USC experience as possible,” said Feighery, a general member of the committee for accessibility.</p>
                        <p>Feighery, a junior majoring in political science, said he looks to increase the number of hybrid classes and address mental health concerns with counseling and therapy.</p>
                        <p>He also seeks to improve safety, accountability and transparency at USC. He supports the Abolish Greek Life movement and is eager to bridge the gap between students involved with USG and the wider USC community.</p>

                        <p>A commuter and sophomore majoring in political science, Ghazaryan hopes to create a space for commuter students and organize events during high traffic times, and to lower parking pass costs and create a commuter guide.</p>
                        <p>Ghazaryan also wants to release course syllabi prior to course registration. He hopes to encourage students to attend discussion forums at senate meetings and create a Q&A section on the USG website.</p>
                        <p>“Having that option will bridge the gap between the student body and undergraduate student government,” Ghazaryan said.</p>

                        <p>Bridge and Zand look to expand Halal and Kosher options, increase late-night food access and make syllabi public on Web Registration.</p>
                        <p>They also intend to build on current student organizations involved in South Central to address community needs.</p>

                        <p>Devin Ayala and Navya Singh based their senatorial ticket on a combined passion to connect USC’s student body with the daily inner workings of the Undergraduate Student Government.</p>
                        <p>“There is an isolation and separation,” said Singh, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “If elected, we’d really want to fill that gap.”</p>
                        <p>A primary focus for the pair is Department of Public Safety budget transparency. Ayala, a sophomore majoring in environmental science and health, currently sits on the USG external affairs committee and plans to work alongside student leaders to reimagine public safety.</p>
                        <p>“Budget transparency is a really big thing,” Ayala stated. “We plan to streamline this … with student leaders who are really passionate about DPS reform.”</p>

                        <p>Barun and Gillath look to expand Trojans Give Back to donate leftover USC meal swipes to local food banks.</p>

                        <h3>CAMERON CORNELIO & ANDREW TAW</h3>
                        <p>Cameron Cornelio and Andrew Taw are running on a platform to bring more transparency and inclusion to USC’s student government by encouraging cross-communication between on-campus student identity assemblies by facilitating inclusive events for student identity organizations.</p>
                        <p>“I think that there’s the opportunity for inclusivity there, to learn from and about your peers,” said Cornelio, a junior majoring in intelligence and cyber operations.</p>
                        <p>Their platform also includes advocating for more inclusivity of transfer students by addressing issues with USC’s tuition assistance program, transfer specific advisors and other tasks. Cornelio and Taw also feel that all USC students deserve more transparency about Greek life and greater sustainable efforts beyond campus.</p>

                        <p>Alvaro Flores and Jake Stemmons are running for senate to pursue practical improvements within student organization operations, financial efficiency and overall student life.</p>
                        <p>Both are involved in registered student organizations — Flores, a vice president of the USC Economics Association and Techie, and Stemmons, president of the USC Economics Association. The duo seek to streamline the process for RSOs to receive USG funds. Flores and Stemmons also look to provide expanded support to RSO leaders in hopes of helping student organizations continue as a “pillar of the USC community.”</p>
                        <p>Flores and Stemmons also aim to improve coronavirus protocols by working with USC to open additional testing sites.</p>

                        <p>Sam Habibi and Kennedi Templeton look to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility. Their experience under former student governments drive their vision.</p>
                        <p>The candidate duo advocate for different and overlooked experiences — such as those of transfer and commuter students — that come with the diverse USC student body.</p>
                        <p>“It shouldn’t just be 12 senators deciding on what legislation they’re working on, so that’s why we’re also trying to implement a platform where students can reach out and make it more like a personal connection,” said Habibi, a sophomore majoring in public policy.</p>
                        <p>If elected, they seek to further efforts towards reducing carbon emissions and invest more of the student budget into sustainability efforts.</p>

                        <p>Michelle Lu and Sanjana Sambhwani aim to amplify students’ voices based on a platform of accountability, mental health, inclusivity, and community.</p>
                        <p>“We feel real advocacy lies with forming these face-to-face connections and that’s what we’ve been so profound about this entire campaign,” said Sambhwani, a freshman majoring in cognitive science.</p>
                        <p>The candidates also hope to emphasize the importance of bringing allcove, a physical mental health center, to the USC students and the youth of South Central.</p>
                        <p>“People … genuinely want to create change on campus,” said Lu, a freshman majoring in business administration.</p>

                        <p>William Lee looks to make strides for prioritizing students’ mental health and highlighting USC’s various academic resources.</p>
                        <p>After his friends voiced concerns about their mental health issues as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Lee was motivated to expand mental health services for other students.</p>
                        <p>“I would … give [recognized student organizations] seats within our wellness committee,” said Lee, a junior majoring in history and political science. “Then, together, we would be able to form a coherent plan and then petition the University administration, who would ultimately be responsible for hiring more staff providing more services.”</p>
                        <p>Lee seeks to also increase USG’s transparency on their ongoing projects and duties.</p>
